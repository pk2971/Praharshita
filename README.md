# [Project 1: Predicting AirBNB Prices](https://github.com/pk2971/AirBNB-pricing-prediction-analysis/blob/main/AirBNB_pricing_prediction_analysis_Praharshita_Kaithepalli.ipynb)

- Created a project to predict the prices of AirBNB listings based off on various factors.
- Cleaned a data set with over 30,000 rows to make it available for training.
- Used various algorithms such as LinearRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor etc. to obtain the best performing model.
- MSE, RMSE and R^2 obtained to study the prediction accuracy for each algorithm
- Hyperparameter tuning performed on the best performing algorithm(XGBoost) to obtain better prediction scores.
