# Praharshita Kaithepalli
Hello recruiter! 
I am a data science Masters student at Rochester Institute of Technology, I enjoy working with challenging and real-world datasets to derive meaningful insights and business-oriented solutions. I am looking for Summer/Fall 22' internships. These are some of my projects I've worked on. 

# [Predicting AirBNB Prices using Regression Models-Python](https://github.com/pk2971/AirBNB-pricing-prediction-analysis/blob/main/AirBNB_pricing_prediction_analysis_Praharshita_Kaithepalli.ipynb)

- Created a project to predict the prices of AirBNB listings based off on various factors.
- Cleaned a data set with over 30,000 rows to make it available for training.
- Used various algorithms such as LinearRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor etc. to obtain the best performing model.
- MSE, RMSE and R^2 obtained to study the prediction accuracy for each algorithm
- Hyperparameter tuning performed on the best performing algorithm(XGBoost) to obtain better prediction scores.

# [Temperature Prediction using Air Quality, Multivariate Time Series Forecasting-Python](https://github.com/pk2971/Air-Quality-vs-Temperature-time-series)

- Built a time series forcasting model to predict the atmospheric temperature at a given time of the day.
- Cleaned a data set of 9000+ rows and prepared it to enable time series forecasting.
- Trained the data set on Conv1D and LSTM models and achieved high accuracy.
- Graphed the predicted vs. actual values of both data sets.

# [COVID-19 Image Classifier using VGG16-Python](https://github.com/pk2971/COVID-19-Image-Classification)

- Built a classifier to identify if a lung is effected by COVID-19 based on scan images.
- Used an ImageGenerator to scale images so that they can be efficiently used by the model.
- Used transfer learning on a CNN trained VGG16, which created time efficient and solid results.
- Predicted if the lung is effected by COVID-19 with 99% accuracy(from a new image).


# [Twitter Sentiment Mining-R language](https://github.com/pk2971/Twitter-setiment-mining)
- Extracted 2000 tweets from Twitter website about Fenty Beauty cosmetic company and stored them in data frames.
- Cleaned the tweet text data from mentions, emojis, profanities and various other symbols.
- Removed data in the tweeets not relating to the cosmetic company.
- Created wordclouds of different products to see what is being talked about the most.
- Performed setiment analysis and assigned sentiment score to tweets using afinn and syuzhet packages.
- Tableau used to further visualize the sentiment scores of the tweets for different products in a particular year.
- Simplified the findings to report it to a non-technical person
