# [Predicting AirBNB Prices using Regression Models](https://github.com/pk2971/AirBNB-pricing-prediction-analysis/blob/main/AirBNB_pricing_prediction_analysis_Praharshita_Kaithepalli.ipynb)

- Created a project to predict the prices of AirBNB listings based off on various factors.
- Cleaned a data set with over 30,000 rows to make it available for training.
- Used various algorithms such as LinearRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor etc. to obtain the best performing model.
- MSE, RMSE and R^2 obtained to study the prediction accuracy for each algorithm
- Hyperparameter tuning performed on the best performing algorithm(XGBoost) to obtain better prediction scores.

# [Temperature Prediction using Air Quality- Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/pk2971/Air-Quality-vs-Temperature-time-series)

- Built a time series forcasting model to predict the atmospheric temperature at a given time of the day.
- Cleaned a data set of 9000+ rows and prepared it to enable time series forecasting.
- Trained the data set on Conv1D and LSTM models and achieved high accuracy.
- Graphed the predicted vs. actual values of both data sets.

# [COVID-19 Image Classifier using VGG16](https://github.com/pk2971/COVID-19-Image-Classification)

- Built a classifier to identify if a lung is effected by COVID-19 based on scan images.
- Predicted if the lung is effected by COVID-19 with 99% accuracy(from a new image).
- Used transfer learning on a CNN trained VGG16, which created time efficient and solid results.
