#Project 1: Predicting AirBNB Prices
Created a project to predict the prices of AirBNB listings based off on various factors.
Cleaned a data set with over 30,000 rows to make it available for training.
Used various algorithms such as LinearRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor etc. to obtain the best performing model.
MSE, RMSE and R^2 obtained to study the prediction accuracy for each algorithm
Hyperparameter tuning performed on the best performing algorithm(XGBoost) to obtain better prediction scores.
